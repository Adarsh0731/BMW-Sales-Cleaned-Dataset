## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process

The following data cleaning steps were performed:

* Checked dataset structure using `.info()`
* Analyzed statistical distribution using `.describe()`
* Identified and handled **missing (null) values**
* Detected and reviewed **duplicate records**
* Ensured columns were in an analysis-ready format

This process ensures data reliability before moving to analysis.
